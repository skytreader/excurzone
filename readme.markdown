# ExkurZones

## Premise

You have arrived at your assignment: a planet held captive by the evil Exkur
Empire. Observing from a covert location at the atmosphere, you send your
sabotage probe to destroy military outposts and free the planet. Unfortunately,
the rebellion's intelligence and equipment is lacking. Can you destroy the main
headquarters before the The Empire's counterdefense detects your presence?

In every turn, the sabotage probe sends a radar ping to detect how far away the
enemy bases are. Unfortunately, you are not sure whether or not the radar
computer has given you the _shortest path_ to the enemy bases!

> ### Note
>
> The radar computes the [_great circle distance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance)
> between you and the probe and the bases. However, faulty instrumentation means
> sometimes it returns the major arc instead of the minor arc of the great
> circle!
