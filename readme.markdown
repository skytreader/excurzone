# ExkurZones

## Premise

You have arrived at your assignment: a planet held captive by the evil Exkur
Empire. Observing from a covert location at the atmosphere, you send your
sabotage probe to destroy military outposts and free the planet. Unfortunately,
the rebellion's intelligence and equipment is lacking. Can you destroy all the
bases before the The Empire's counterdefense detects your presence?

In every turn, the sabotage probe sends a radar ping to detect how far away the
enemy bases are. Unfortunately, you are not sure whether or not the radar
computer has given you the _shortest path_ to the enemy bases!

Meanwhile, as your probe travels between points, the Exkur counterdefenses are
also working to find your ship and shoot at you from orbit.

But all is not lost! Once your probe has visited (and destroyed) a base, the
base's location is also revealed on your map. Moreover, in some of the bases,
your probe can salvage parts and information that would make radar pings more
accurate.
